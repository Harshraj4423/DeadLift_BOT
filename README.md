# DeadLift Bot
### The goal of our machine learning model is to track Dead position and cout the number of  reps , probability of accurate position.

Pose estimation is a computer vision task that infers the pose of a person or object in an mage or video. We can also think of pose estimation as the problem of determining the position and orientation of a camera relative to a given person or object. This is typically done by identifying, locating, and tracking a number of keypoints on a given object or person. For objects, this could be corners or other significant features. And for humans, these keypoints represent major joints like an elbow or knee.

### Take Notes 
1) Creating  Data-Set.

2) Use open-cv and Python to access the WebCam.

3) Extracting the Body’s Coordinate.(Using Mediapipe Model)

4) Collecting keypoints for specific  Poses (Example : ‘up’ , ‘down’ (in this case) ) Save  them in csv file.

5) Build a Custom Trained Scikit Learn Classifier Model.
